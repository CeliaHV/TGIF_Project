# TGIF_Project
First Dynamic Website made it with HTML, CSS & Javascript.

Project: I'm a developer at Code of the Web, a small software shop that creates custom JavaScript-based web applications. Transparent Government in Fact (TGIF), a non-partisan non-profit organization working to increase the publicâ€™s involvement in government, has hired me to develop a Congressional tracking web site for them. I've worked on this web application using modern JavaScript technologies, including AJAX, JSON, and RESTful APIs.

Using the following key technologies and organizing frameworks:
- JavaScript and sophisticated JavaScript libraries, such as jQuery and AngularJS.
- AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to communicate directly with web services from a web page.
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) to encode complex data in a portable compact human-readable format.
- RESTful (Representational State Transfer) APIs (Application Program Interfaces) to standardize the messages used to get JSON objects with AJAX calls.
